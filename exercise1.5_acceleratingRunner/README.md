### Description

This is a proof of concept of a varying acceleration. The exercise is basically
a small square whose position is changed according to velocity and
acceleration.

While the up key is pressed, the velocity is increased according to a fixed
acceleration. While the down key is pressed, the velocity is decreased.

Bounds are not checked.
